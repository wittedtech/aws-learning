# Cloud Computing Overview

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Types of Cloud

1. **Public Cloud**: The entire computing infrastructure is located on the premises of a cloud computing company that offers the cloud service.
2. **Private Cloud**: Hosting all your computing infrastructure yourself and is not shared. The security and control level is highest while using a private network.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Using both private and public clouds, depending on their purpose. You host your most important applications on your own servers to keep them more secure and secondary applications elsewhere.

## Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Reduced Expenditure**: Focus on building the business rather than investing in hardware infrastructure and data centers. Cloud costs depend on consumption.
2. **Security**: Offers great security for sensitive data. Data stored in the system can be easily accessed even if something happens to your computer. Data can be remotely wiped from lost machines.
3. **Reduced Carbon Footprint**: Significantly reduces power, IT infrastructure, and resource consumption by offering resources as per demand, reducing e-waste and environmental impact.
4. **Lower Costs**: Free from capital expenditure. No huge hardware costs. Pay-as-you-go model based on subscription plans.
5. **24/7 Availability**: Most cloud providers offer reliable services with an uptime of 99.9%. Applications can be accessed from anywhere.
6. **Global Access**: Work from anywhere with an internet connection. No device limitations for critical cloud services with mobile apps.
7. **Automated Software Updates**: Server suppliers regularly update your software, including security updates, saving time on system maintenance.
8. **Internet Through Vendors**: Internet connectivity is managed by the vendors.

## Risks of Cloud Computing

1. Privacy Agreement and Service Level Agreement
2. Location of Data
3. Security and Data Protection
4. Legislation and Regulation
5. Privacy Agreement and Service Level Agreement

## What is Amazon EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.

## Difference between Cloud and Server

1. **Storage Expansion**: Expanding storage in the cloud environment does not incur any downtime. Dedicated servers require maintenance downtime to change processors. Websites hosted on a single server that require additional processing capabilities need total migration or networking with another server.
2. **Technology**: Normal servers refer to regular physical technology installed in a room, while cloud servers are perceived as online systems that can store a large amount of data, deliver software services, balance loading time, automate business processes and operations, and allow customization for the user.

## Additional Topics

### Cloud Service Models

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Delivers hardware and software tools over the internet. Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet. Examples: Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365.

### Cloud Deployment Models

1. **Community Cloud**: Shared infrastructure for a specific community.
2. **Distributed Cloud**: Public-resource computing within a distributed infrastructure.
3. **Multi-cloud**: Use of multiple cloud services from different providers.

### Key Concepts in Cloud Security

1. **Data Encryption**: Protecting data by transforming it into a secure format.
2. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Ensuring that the right individuals access the right resources.
3. **Compliance**: Adhering to standards and regulations related to cloud usage.
